According to what has been exposed, the main outcome of this study consisted of a journey of increase and change in awareness (Freeman, 1989, p. 33) encompassed by the reflective practice (Schön, 1983, Kindle location 4376) that allowed us to set the base of our pedagogical practice as foreign language teachers.
It also became clear that the indispensable lifelong evolution of the pedagogical practice via the strategy of development (Freeman, 1989, p. 40) can be systematised through the Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb, 2015, p. 50-51) assisted by a diary as a reflection-on-action (Schön, 1983) tool.
The diary, in turn, encompassed by reflective writing (van Manen, 2016, p. 111), was revealed as a practice of human science research devoted to study the nature of the lived experiences in and around the classroom.
Revisiting the question "What defines a satisfactory learning experience for C1 Advanced learners of English in the context of the C1 Advanced Preparation Tutorial over a remote learning setting?" it is possible to realise that there cannot be an answer under the Positivist paradigm. Therefore, we believe that it has been demonstrated that the reflective practice, which was the backbone of this study, can be instrumental in making informed decisions according to each particular case considering the complex nature of the events that occur in the classroom.
However, as Celani (2008, p. 39) emphasises, the reflective practice per se does not account for what a teacher in their own right must be. According to her, the reflective practice for a teacher must include a strong commitment to citizenship. In that sense, a comprehensive, critical study on the role of teachers in society, which is outside the scope of this study, can offer an opportunity for further research.
